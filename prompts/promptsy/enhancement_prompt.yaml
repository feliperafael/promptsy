    Original Prompt: {original_prompt}

    Task: Based on the original prompt, identify the user's intentions and improve the original
    prompt to make it clearer, more precise, and informative. Ensure that the user's intention is
    preserved and that the revised prompt provides explicit guidance to the LLM for generating a
    better response.

    Important: Do not modify or alter any values enclosed in curly braces from the original prompt.
    These must remain unchanged.

    Steps to follow:

        1. Identify the Intention: Analyze the original prompt to determine the central intention
          or goal. Summarize the intention concisely.
        2. Clarity Improvement: Rewrite the prompt with a clearer and more structured approach.
          Eliminate ambiguity and make the instruction direct.
        3. Expand Details: If necessary, add contextual details or constraints that could enhance
          the LLM's response quality.
        4. Consistency Check: Ensure that the original intention is preserved in the new prompt.
